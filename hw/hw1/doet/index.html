    <h2>Design Flaws</h2>
    <p>Some aspects of the controls follow the natural mappings typical of light switches in the US: flipping the switch upward signifies the “on” position, while turning it downwards is meant to convey the switch is “off.” However, a rather large issue with this design is the existence of two switches. In the user’s model, perhaps the right switch controls the right half, or the top half, of the light, while the left switch controls the left side or the bottom. Perhaps the opposite! But, in either case, the user design is different from the design model, which is that both switches accomplish the same task: turning the light “on” or “off.”</p>
    <p>By providing two switches, the system image implied that the light had two variables to be controlled, instead of just the one. This leaves the viewer with an incorrect mental model of the light fixture and severely decreases the learnability and efficiency of its use. These issues are compounded by a lack of feedback in some cases. If, for instance, the light switch was already primed in the “on” position on one side of the controls, flipping the other side to “on” does nothing. This also means that both sides of the controls must be turned to “off” if the user wishes to turn the light off. So, while the controls do not have multiple functions, both switch positions (“on” or “off”) can translate to the light being bright or dark, and the correct position on the other light switch is necessary to achieve some results, which dampens the understandability of the system and makes results appear arbitrary to the average user, further negatively impacting both the learnability and efficiency.</p>

    <h2>Remedy</h2>
    <p>Fixing the issue could be gone about one of two ways:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Adding one of the features described as a typical user model above</li>
      <li>Removing one of the switches from the design</li>
    </ol>
    <p>By adding another light feature, such as the ability to turn on only half of the light (oriented left-and-right or top-and-bottom), the designer would be able to orient the light features to have a more natural function, such as the left switch turning on the left half of the lefts and the right switch dealing with the right side. By condensing the controls to only one switch, the system image would imply that there are only two light states (which, at this time, is correct)—“on” ad “off.” Either of these changes would greatly increase the learnability of the system, and therefore also its efficiency.</p>
